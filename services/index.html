        <p>Security is a complex and dynamic issue, and most companies lack the time, knowledge and capabilities to manage it effectively. At Beyond Binary, we help companies of all shapes and sizes to realistically assess their security stance, and guide them in responding appropriately to weak spots. Over time, our partners better understand the nature of the technology landscape, improve their defensive capability, and correctly identify the elements of their security strategy that need attention.</p>

                    <h3>Full Attack Simulation</h3>
                    <p>This comprehensive service taps into technical, physical and social channels, and will give the most accurate assessment of a company’s ability to defend itself. We deploy a range of appropriate techniques against the company, using both public and customised tools, in order to measure its readiness for real-world attack.</p>

                    <h3>MITRE ATT&amp;CK Service</h3>
                    <p>This service aims to validate the implementation of your EDR and monitoring solutions. The assessment consists of a series of "malicious" activities that map to the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK Framework</a> TTPs, which are timestamped and logged by the assessment team. Any and all actions performed by the defensive tooling are crosschecked against the activities, and any issues (such as false positives, or gaps in alerting) are reported on. This service is proving to be a huge hit for many of our clients and is a great stepping-stone towards a <strong>Full Attack Simulation</strong>.</p>

                    <h3>Offensive Security Training and Defence Drills</h3>
                    <p>Companies that have a security ‘blue team’ in place are advised to periodically engage in offensive training and defence drills. This ensures the team remains up to date with security developments, and helps them verify that the company’s systems are configured and functioning correctly. Beyond Binary is able to work with blue teams to simulate a range of compromise scenarios in a controlled setting. This allows team members to note the indicators of attack, validate the SIEM (Security Information &amp; Event Management) configuration, and refine their ability to shut down an active intrusion.</p>

                    <h3>Remediation Guidance and Advice</h3>
                    <p>Beyond Binary does not provide remediation services. We believe this is in direct conflict with the provision of offensive security services. Where indicated, Beyond Binary will aid in sourcing an appropriate service provider/s for the remediation phase. By remaining impartial, we can objectively assess any remediation attempts, and continue to work with you in a realistic and unbiased manner.</p>

              <p>Though it isn't widely known, support for Domain Fronting was added to Metasploit and Meterpreter by OJ Reeves in late 2017. Part of the reason that it's not common knowledge is the lack of documentation or discussion around how to use it. As a result, we decided to create this post so that users of Metasploit have a decent guide on how to configure and use Domain Fronting over HTTPS with a legitimate certificate.</p>
